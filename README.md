# Properties of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation
This project explores the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, one of the simplest PDEs that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. All code is written in Julia. Some things found in this repository are:
* **brusselator.ipynb**: an integrator of a 2-dimensional brusselator, a simpler example of pattern formation with nontrivial steady-state solutions.
* **kuramoto_sivashinsky.ipynb**: an integrator for the kuramoto-sivashinsky equation, both in integral and derivative form.
* **writeup.pdf**: (coming soon) a writeup that explores history and properties of the KS equation.
